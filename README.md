# Install a Solace PubSub+ Software Message Broker onto Google Compute Engine Linux Virtual Machines

This repository explains how to install a Solace PubSub+ Software Message Broker in various configurations onto Google Compute Engine (GCE) Linux Virtual Machines. This guide is intended mainly for development and demo purposes.

# Description of the Solace PubSub+ Software Message Broker

The Solace PubSub+ software message broker meets the needs of big data, cloud migration, and Internet-of-Things initiatives, and enables microservices and event-driven architecture. Capabilities include topic-based publish/subscribe, request/reply, message queues/queueing, and data streaming for IoT devices and mobile/web apps. The message broker supports open APIs and standard protocols including AMQP, JMS, MQTT, REST, and WebSocket. Moreover, it can be deployed in on-premise datacenters, natively within private and public clouds, and across complex hybrid cloud environments.

Solace PubSub+ software message brokers can be deployed in either a 3-node High-Availability (HA) cluster, or as a single-node deployment. For simple test environments that need only to validate application functionality, a single instance will suffice. Note that in production, or any environment where message loss cannot be tolerated, an HA cluster is required.

# How to deploy a message broker

In this quick start we go through the steps to set up a message broker either as a single stand-alone instance, or in a 3-node HA cluster.

This is a 3 step process:

## Step 1 (Optional): Obtain a reference to the Docker image of the Solace PubSub+ message broker to be deployed

First, decide which [Solace PubSub+ message broker](https://docs.solace.com/Solace-SW-Broker-Set-Up/Setting-Up-SW-Brokers.htm ) and version is suitable to your use case.

**Note:** You can skip the rest of this step if using the default settings. By default this project installs the Solace PubSub+ software message router, Standard Edition from the latest Docker image available from Docker Hub.

The Docker image reference can be:

*	A public or accessible private Docker registry repository name with an optional tag. This is the recommended option if using PubSub+ Standard. The default is to use the latest message broker image [available from Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/solace/solace-pubsub-standard/ ) as `solace/solace-pubsub-standard:latest`, or use a specific version [tag](https://hub.docker.com/r/solace/solace-pubsub-standard/tags/ ).

*	A Docker image download URL
     * If using Solace PubSub+ Enterprise Evaluation Edition, go to the Solace Downloads page. For the image reference, copy and use the download URL in the Solace PubSub+ Enterprise Evaluation Edition Docker Images section.

         | PubSub+ Enterprise Evaluation Edition<br/>Docker Image
         | :---: |
         | 90-day trial version of PubSub+ Enterprise |
         | [Get URL of Evaluation Docker Image](http://dev.solace.com/downloads#eval ) |

     * If you have purchased a Docker image of Solace PubSub+ Enterprise, Solace will give you information for how to download the compressed tar archive package from a secure Solace server. Contact Solace Support at support@solace.com if you require assistance. Then you can host this tar archive together with its MD5 on a file server and use the download URL as the image reference.

## Step 2: Create the required GCE Compute Engine instances

The single stand-alone instance requires 1 Compute Engine instance and the HA deployment requires 3 instances for the Primary, Backup and Monitor nodes.

Repeat these instructions for all instances required and follow the specific requirements for HA setup as applicable.

### Step 2a: Select instance machine type and parameters

* Go to your Google Cloud Platform console and create a Compute Engine instance.  Select standard 2 vCPU machine type, and at least 6 GB of memory, a CentOS 7 OS, and a disk with a
size of at least 30 GB depolyed on Centos7 OS:

### Step 2b: (HA cluster deployment only) customise your IP addresses

* If you are configuring 3 HA nodes, expand the Networking tab to edit the Network interfaces panel and customise your IP addresses. You need to pick 3 available internal IPs.

> Tip: gather all 3 IP addresses before continuing by trying availability (there is feedback if entered address is being used by another resource) and designate each one to one of the Primary, Backup and Monitor nodes.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SolaceLabs/solace-gcp-quickstart/master/images/gce_launch_3.png "GCE Image creation 3")

### Step 2c: Add automated startup script

* Expand the the Management tab to expose the Automation Startup script panel

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SolaceLabs/solace-gcp-quickstart/master/images/gce_launch_2.png "GCE Image creation 2")

Cut and paste the code according to your deployment configuration into the panel, replace the value of the variable `SOLACE_DOCKER_IMAGE_REFERENCE` if required to the reference from [Step 1](#step-1-optional-obtain-a-reference-to-the-docker-image-of-the-solace-pubsub-message-broker-to-be-deployed ), and replace `<ADMIN_PASSWORD>` with the desired password for the management `admin` user.

**Note:** For HA deployment additional environment variables are required (see the script section "Add here environment variables..." near the beginning), which will be discussed below.   

```
#!/bin/bash
##################################
# Update following variables as needed:
SOLACE_DOCKER_IMAGE_REFERENCE="solace/solace-pubsub-standard:latest" # default to pull latest PubSub+ standard from docker hub
ADMIN_PASSWORD=<ADMIN_PASSWORD>
##################################
# Add here environment variables for HA deployment, not required for single-node deployment.
# export ... see next section HA deployment environment variables
##################################
#
if [ ! -d /var/lib/solace ]; then
  mkdir /var/lib/solace
  cd /var/lib/solace
  yum install -y wget
  LOOP_COUNT=0
  while [ $LOOP_COUNT -lt 3 ]; do
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SolaceProducts/solace-gcp-quickstart/master/scripts/install-solace.sh
    if [ 0 != `echo $?` ]; then 
      ((LOOP_COUNT++))
    else
      break
    fi
  done
  if [ ${LOOP_COUNT} == 3 ]; then
    echo "`date` ERROR: Failed to download initial install script exiting"
    exit 1
  fi
  chmod +x /var/lib/solace/install-solace.sh
  /var/lib/solace/install-solace.sh -p $ADMIN_PASSWORD -i $SOLACE_DOCKER_IMAGE_REFERENCE
fi
```

#### HA deployment environment variables for the startup script

The environment variables will be specific to the role of the nodes, i.e. Primary, Backup and Monitor.

Assuming `<PrimaryIP>`, `<BackupIP>` and `<MonitorIP>` IP addresses for the nodes, depending on the role, here are the environment variables to be added to the beginning of above startup script:

**Note:** Ensure to replace the `<PrimaryIP>`, `<BackupIP>` and `<MonitorIP>` values according to your settings.

Primary:
```
##These are example values for configuring a primary node
export baseroutername=gcevmr
export nodetype=message_routing
export routername=gcevmr1
export configsync_enable=yes
export redundancy_activestandbyrole=primary
export redundancy_enable=yes
export redundancy_group_password=gruyerecheese
export redundancy_group_node_gcevmr0_connectvia=<MonitorIP>
export redundancy_group_node_gcevmr0_nodetype=monitoring
export redundancy_group_node_gcevmr1_connectvia=<PrimaryIP>
export redundancy_group_node_gcevmr1_nodetype=message_routing
export redundancy_group_node_gcevmr2_connectvia=<BackupIP>
export redundancy_group_node_gcevmr2_nodetype=message_routing
export redundancy_matelink_connectvia=<BackupIP>
```

Backup:
```
##These are example values for configuring a backup node
export baseroutername=gcevmr
export nodetype=message_routing
export routername=gcevmr2
export configsync_enable=yes
export redundancy_activestandbyrole=backup
export redundancy_enable=yes
export redundancy_group_password=gruyerecheese
export redundancy_group_node_gcevmr0_connectvia=<MonitorIP>
export redundancy_group_node_gcevmr0_nodetype=monitoring
export redundancy_group_node_gcevmr1_connectvia=<PrimaryIP>
export redundancy_group_node_gcevmr1_nodetype=message_routing
export redundancy_group_node_gcevmr2_connectvia=<BackupIP>
export redundancy_group_node_gcevmr2_nodetype=message_routing
export redundancy_matelink_connectvia=<PrimaryIP>
```

Monitor:
```
##These are example values for configuring a monitoring node
export baseroutername=gcevmr
export nodetype=monitoring
export routername=gcevmr0
export redundancy_enable=yes
export redundancy_group_password=gruyerecheese
export redundancy_group_node_gcevmr0_connectvia=<MonitorIP>
export redundancy_group_node_gcevmr0_nodetype=monitoring
export redundancy_group_node_gcevmr1_connectvia=<PrimaryIP>
export redundancy_group_node_gcevmr1_nodetype=message_routing
export redundancy_group_node_gcevmr2_connectvia=<BackupIP>
export redundancy_group_node_gcevmr2_nodetype=message_routing
```


### Step 2d: Submit the create request

Now hit the "Create" button on the bottom of this page. This will start the process of starting the GCE instance, installing Docker and finally download and install the message router.  It is possible to access the VM before the entire Solace solution is up.  You can monitor /var/lib/solace/install.log for the following entry: "'date' INFO: Install is complete" to indicate when the install has completed.

#### For HA deployment assert the primary message brokerâ€™s configuration

As described in the [Solace documentation for configuring HA Group](https://docs.solace.com/Configuring-and-Managing/Configuring-HA-Groups.htm ), after a Solace PubSub+ software message broker HA redundancy group is configured to support Guaranteed messaging, assert the primary message brokerâ€™s configuration. This can be done through Solace CLI commands as in the [documentation](https://docs.solace.com/Configuring-and-Managing/Configuring-HA-Groups.htm#Config-Config-Sync ) or running following command at the Primary node:

```
# check redundancy status
curl -sS -u admin:admin http://localhost:8080/SEMP -d "<rpc semp-version=\"soltr/8_5VMR\"><show><re
dundancy></redundancy></show></rpc>"

# wait until redundancy is up the execute next command:
curl -sS -u admin:admin http://localhost:8080/SEMP -d "<rpc semp-version='soltr/8_5VMR'><admin><config-sync><assert-master><router/></assert-master></config-sync></admin></rpc>"
```

## Step 3: Set up network security to allow access

Now that the message broker is instantiated, the network security firewall rule needs to be set up to allow access to both the admin application and data traffic.  Under the "Networking -> VPC network -> Firewall rules" tab add a new rule to your project exposing the required ports:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SolaceLabs/solace-gcp-quickstart/master/images/gce_network.png "GCE Firewall rules")
`tcp:80;tcp:8080;tcp:1883;tcp:8000;tcp:9000;tcp:55003;tcp:55555`

For more information on the ports required for the message router see the [configuration defaults](https://docs.solace.com/Configuring-and-Managing/SW-Broker-Specific-Config/SW-Broker-Configuration-Defaults.htm ). For more information on Google Cloud Platform Firewall rules see [Networking and Firewalls](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networks-and-firewalls ).

It may be also required to allow egress traffic to the internet for certain use cases. In this case create an additional rule using similar steps.

# Gaining admin access to the message broker

Refer to the [Management Tools section](https://docs.solace.com/Management-Tools.htm ) of the online documentation to learn more about the available tools. The WebUI is the recommended simplest way to administer the message broker for common tasks.

## WebUI, SolAdmin and SEMP access

Management IP will be the Public IP associated with your GCE instance and port will be 8080 by default.

**Note:** if using the HA deployment, unless specifically required otherwise, use the GCE instance that is in Active role (this is the Primary node at the initial setup but can be the Backup node after a failover).

## Solace CLI access

Access the web ssh terminal window by clicking the [ssh] button next to your message broker instance, then launch a SolOS cli session:

```sh
$sudo docker exec -it solace /usr/sw/loads/currentload/bin/cli -A
